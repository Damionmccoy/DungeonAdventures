In the event that the font must be provided to a service bureau, a copy may be installed on the service bureau’s computer for the duration of the production of such project. The font software shall then be removed by the service bureau after all work has been completed, or a separate license must be purchased by that service vendor in order to retain legal use of the font software.

You may utilize these fonts in any type of creative project, whether they are non-commercial or commercial in nature.

You may make one (1) back-up copy of the font software solely for archiving purposes.

You may not rename the font file or alter any of the copyright or ownership or descriptive information. If a font contains picture images, such images are the original artwork and exclusive property of Peter H. Rempel. These images may not be used, augmented or changed in any way, shape or form in order to comprise proprietary logos, derivative works or any end result which shall cause confusion as to the ownership of these images.
