I have been asked several times to define "personal use", and it is sometimes ambiguous.  In general, if you are making something for yourself, or for someone you love, it is definitely personal. If you are making a gift for customers or investors in your company, even though it is not being sold, it is part of your business, and this personal.

Even if it is personal use, if it is worth something to you, I would appreciatre some kind of donation. While I love making fonts, it is a lot of work and the more donations I receive, the more time I am able to devote to this art, which i hope gave you some joy.
